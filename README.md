# Pancreatic Cancer Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm

## Overview

Pancreatic cancer is a deadly disease with a low survival rate, and early detection is critical for improving patient outcomes. This project aims to predict the presence of pancreatic cancer using a Decision Tree algorithm. It focuses on differentiating between three categories: pancreatic cancer (3), non-cancerous pancreas conditions (2), and healthy (1).

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information related to pancreatic cancer, including various features and the corresponding diagnosis. Please note that the dataset includes information on the stage of pancreatic cancer, which is not available for predictive modeling. The primary goal is to predict the presence of the disease before it's diagnosed, not after.

## Requirements

- Python
- Libraries and dependencies (e.g., scikit-learn, pandas, numpy)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rahulkannan0784/Pancreatic-Cancer-Detection.git


## Data Preprocessing
Explain any data preprocessing steps that were performed on the dataset, such as cleaning, feature selection, and scaling.

## Model Training
Provide information about the Decision Tree model, its hyperparameters, and how the model was trained.

## Evaluation
Discuss the metrics used to evaluate the model's performance, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Include any visualizations of the model's performance.

## Results
Summarize the findings and results of the pancreatic cancer prediction using the Decision Tree algorithm.
